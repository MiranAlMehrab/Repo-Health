As of this patch, we send a trivial RPC to the data server\r\nand wait for its response before committing to use the new loading\r\npaths. This adds about 1\u20135ms total time to the happy path on my machine,\r\nwith a worst case penalty of 5s due to the timeout. If the server is not\r\nreachable, we print a warning and fall back to the legacy paths.\r\n\r\nTest Plan:\r\n\r\n  - Test with normal working TensorBoard.\r\n\r\n  - Simulate failed data server connection by changing the definition of\r\n    `addr` to `\"localhost:%d\" % (port + 777)` on line 175. This should\r\n    print the `UNAVAILABLE`/\u201cfailed to connect\u201d message from #4844.\r\n\r\n  - Simulate slow data server by adding the following to `cli.rs`:\r\n\r\n    ```rust\r\n    tokio::time::sleep(Duration::from_secs(3)).await;\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    Add this right before the `Server::builder().(...).await?` call at\r\n    the end of `main`: i.e., after we write the port file, but before we\r\n    actually respond to requests. Note that TensorBoard still works with\r\n    a 3-second delay, but that it actually delays printing the startup\r\n    message for those 3 seconds as it determines which data provider to\r\n    use.\r\n\r\n  - Simulate extra-slow data provider as above but waiting 6 seconds,\r\n    and note that TensorBoard prints a `DEADLINE_EXCEEDED` error, falls\r\n    back to the legacy paths, and shows valid data.\r\n\r\nwchargin-branch: data-liveness-check\r\nwchargin-source: 7fd916ebcf426d92babaeb57c38789d47446df6e", "author_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wchargin", "committer_url": "https://api.github.com/users/web-flow", "author_commit_date": "2021-04-09T16:46:29Z", "committer_commit_date": "2021-04-09T16:46:29Z"}

Alternatives considered:\r\n\r\n 1. Add a `logdir_supported` function to the data server Pip package.\r\n    This is nice because we could push a new data server release with\r\n    new filesystems without having to push a new TensorBoard release.\r\n    But it doesn\u2019t suffice for the cases where the data server binary\r\n    doesn\u2019t come from the Pip package (i.e., when it comes from a Bazel\r\n    `--define` or an environment variable).\r\n\r\n 2. Add a `--check-logdir` flag to the data server to directly ask it to\r\n    check whether it can handle a given filesystem. This is nice because\r\n    it has the benefit of (1) without the aforementioned drawback. It\r\n    also makes it more natural to do subtler checks, like \u201cGCS logdirs\r\n    are okay if the user\u2019s credentials are of a supported variety\u201d. But\r\n    it requires launching the data server twice and throwing away the\r\n    first result ([parse, don\u2019t validate][pdv]). Also, it\u2019d require\r\n    releasing a new data server binary, which is inconvenient in the\r\n    short term.\r\n\r\n 3. Teach the data server to exit with a special exit code if it can\r\n    tell that the log directory is unsupported. Then, try starting a\r\n    data server ingester, and fall back to a local ingester if that\r\n    fails. This has the benefits of (1) and (2), and avoids the problem\r\n    of validating the input twice. It would still require a release, and\r\n    is also a bit more complicated mechanically.\r\n\r\nI think that I like (3) for the long term and will consider implementing\r\nit.

The answer is insidious: `RunPaths` returns the raw\r\nunderlying dictionary, not a shallow copy of it, so changes to the\r\ninternal structures of the multiplexer are immediately reflected in the\r\nprojector plugin. This is a bit terrifying, since it means both that the\r\ncode is wildly non-threadsafe and that it\u2019s hard to tell when the data\r\nhas actually changed. (The terror is somewhat abated by remembering that\r\nconcurrency safety around dicts in Python is all just pretend, anyway.)\r\n\r\nThis patch modifies the projector plugin to always shallow-copy the\r\nresult of `RunPaths`, and makes the necessary follow-up changes to\r\nobserve updates to the data. The result is that `RunPaths` is called\r\nmore times, up to once on each HTTP handler or `is_active` call. This is\r\nfine: it\u2019s expected that plugin routes may hit the multiplexer or data\r\nprovider, and since the projector plugin only really works locally, this\r\nshould be fast enough to not matter.\r\n\r\nIn doing so, we also improve the update semantics, since we can test\r\nprecisely for cache invalidation rather than just looking at the count\r\nof runs. There are almost certainly still observable concurrency issues;\r\nthis patch doesn\u2019t try to fix them all.\r\n\r\nThe eventual goal of this series of patches is to remove the dependency\r\non the multiplexer entirely, so the call to `RunPaths` will become a\r\ncall to a data provider\u2019s `list_runs` and merging in `flags.logdir`.\r\n\r\nTest Plan:\r\nThe projector plugin still works in the normal case (shows embeddings\r\nwith sprites, etc.). Edge cases to check:\r\n\r\n  - Point TensorBoard at a logdir containing only non-projector data.\r\n    Launch TensorBoard and wait a bit for the projector to finish\r\n    determining that it has no data. Then add one projector run to the\r\n    logdir and refresh TensorBoard (but do not restart the server). Note\r\n    that the projector plugin properly picks up the new run. Repeat, and\r\n    note that it picks up the newer run, too (i.e., the cache can be\r\n    updated even when it\u2019s non-empty).\r\n\r\n  - Point TensorBoard at a logdir where the `projector_config.pbtxt` is\r\n    inside a logdir\u2019s plugin assets directory:\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    logs/run/plugins/org_tensorflow_tensorboard_projector/projector_config.pbtxt\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    Note that the config is still resolved properly. You can tell that\r\n    it\u2019s using the plugin assets because if you comment out the\r\n    `_append_plugin_asset_directories` call, the embeddings will still\r\n    be displayed but will lack sprite information.\r\n\r\nwchargin-branch: projector-fix-aliasing", "author_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wchargin", "committer_url": "https://api.github.com/users/web-flow", "author_commit_date": "2020-12-17T20:08:22Z", "committer_commit_date": "2020-12-17T20:08:22Z"}

The compilation occurs in the build graph via a genrule,\r\nand then the generated files are reflected into the source tree. A Bazel\r\ntest verifies that they are kept in sync.\r\n\r\nWe reflect the generated files into the source tree so that IDE tooling\r\nlike `rust-analyzer` can analyze these files more correctly and quickly.\r\nThere are ways to get `rust-analyzer` to consider generated files, but\r\nthey\u2019re primarily meant for integration with Cargo `build.rs`, not Bazel\r\n(though [Bazel `rules_rust` support for `rust_analyzer` is on the\r\nroadmap][rr-ra]). Such configurations also force `rust-analyzer` to\r\nexecute the genrule-equivalent, which isn\u2019t instant, especially when the\r\nbuild dependencies have not yet been built.\r\n\r\nAlso, `rules_rust` doesn\u2019t yet seem to support using generated files in\r\na `rust_library`/`rust_binary`, so this is necessary for now, anyway.\r\n\r\nWe compile the bindings in the build graph, rather than just providing a\r\nbinary that runs the compilation process, primarily because this gives\r\nbetter control over the execution environment. The data dependencies\r\nhere are a bit finicky, and the genrule environment is well defined. By\r\ncontrast, a binary could be run either via `bazel run` or `bazel-bin/`,\r\nand either at the repo root or the package directory. By using a\r\ngenrule, we only have to support one configuration.\r\n\r\nUsing a genrule also wins slightly better caching behavior: a normal\r\nbuild of our Rust library doesn\u2019t actually need to pull in `prost-build`\r\n(though running the tests does).\r\n\r\nThe generated files are not subject to `rustfmt` because of how they\u2019re\r\n`include!`d into the crate.

This patch conditionally\r\nrolls back the change for Colab only. This includes rolling it back for\r\npublic Colab, where it worked fine. We hope that this isn\u2019t too big of a\r\nproblem, since we expect that most Colab users are inspecting datasets\r\nwith few runs (generated from within Colab) rather than massive\r\nhyperparameter sweeps. We also hope that we can simply revert this patch\r\nonce the Google-internal behavior is fixed.\r\n\r\nJupyter environments are unaffected (and still work).\r\n\r\nWe used to have a global `window.TENSORBOARD_ENV` that listed whether we\r\nwere in Colab, but we removed that in #2798 because we thought that it\r\nwas no longer necessary. Since in that PR we switched to create an\r\niframe rather than manually linking and loading the HTML (much nicer, to\r\nbe sure), we now plumb this information via a query parameter.

Then, build the Pip package\r\n(`bazel run //tensorboard/pip_package:extract_pip_packages`), upload it\r\nto public Colab, and install it into the runtime. Verify that the scalar\r\ncharts still work there, albeit without multiplexing.

This\r\nreduces network overhead, improves throughput due to higher request\r\nconcurrency, and offers the opportunity for data providers to more\r\nefficiently request the data in batch.\r\n\r\nThis is implemented with a new POST route `/scalars_multirun`, since the\r\nlist of run names may be long. The frontend is configured to batch\r\nrequests to at most 64 runs at once, so the multiplexing is bounded.\r\n\r\nThis only affects the scalars plugin. Other scalar chart sources, like\r\nPR curves, custom scalars, and the hparams metrics views, are not\r\naffected.\r\n\r\nSupersedes #3835, with the same idea and same general backend approach,\r\nbut using the frontend APIs enabled by #4045.\r\n\r\nTest Plan:\r\nOn the hparams demo with four charts showing, each fetching 50 runs, we\r\nnow make only four requests as opposed to 200.

This is useful because when the set of requested keys expands,\r\nonly the new keys need to be fetched. But, until now, the behavior has\r\nbeen hard-coded to fire a separate request for each key-value pair.\r\nClients can have either fine-grained cache invalidation or efficient\r\nbatched requests, but not both at the same time. This patch enriches the\r\nbehavior to support just that.\r\n\r\nIn a future change, the scalars dashboard will take advantage of this to\r\nbatch requests for multiple runs and a single tag. This will only\r\nrequire changing the `requestData` function in `tf-scalar-card`.\r\n\r\nIn doing so, we need to shuffle around the API a bit. Instead of asking\r\nclients to provide `getDataLoadUrl: (Item) => string` plus a separate\r\nfunction `requestData: (url: string) => Promise<Data>` (where \u201c`Item`\u201d\r\nand \u201c`Data`\u201d are the keys and values, respectively), clients now provide\r\na single function `requestData` that takes raw `Item`s (now plural),\r\nperforms the request(s), and returns the data. The function provides a\r\nstream of key-value pairs, which is represented in callback style for\r\nconvenience. (We don\u2019t want to drag Observable into this.)\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this approach, as opposed to a perhaps more natural\r\napproach that simply adapts `getDataLoadUrl` to return some kind of\r\nrequest struct with a callback to map a response into key-value pairs,\r\nis to accommodate the variety of existing clients. The structures get\r\npretty wild: e.g., `tf-line-chart-data-loader` mixes in the behavior but\r\ndoesn\u2019t actually provide the needed properties; they\u2019re provided instead\r\nby `tf-scalar-card`, but then `tf-hparams-session-group-details` further\r\noverrides some of those properties of `tf-scalar-card` with an entirely\r\ndifferent backend. It\u2019s a bit wordier for clients, but at least there\r\nare fewer moving pieces to keep track of.\r\n\r\nTest Plan:\r\nThe scalars, custom scalars, distributions, histograms, PR curves, and\r\nhparams dashboards all work. The fine-grained invalidation on the\r\nscalars dashboard works: e.g., set the tag filter to `mnist` and then to\r\n`mnist|hparams`, and watch only the hparams demo data load; then, set it\r\nto `hparams` and watch the MNIST charts disappear without any repaints\r\nto the hparams demo charts. The post-load callback properly causes\r\nscalar charts\u2019 domains to adjust. The refresh button in the dashboard UI\r\nproperly invalidates and re-fetches data.\r\n\r\n(Make sure to run with `TB_POLYMER3=1` until that\u2019s the default.)\r\n\r\nwchargin-branch: dlb-batch-finegrained", "author_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wchargin", "committer_url": "https://api.github.com/users/web-flow", "author_commit_date": "2020-08-19T17:18:40Z", "committer_commit_date": "2020-08-19T17:18:40Z"}

But the initialization is expensive when extensions are\r\nin play: it requires iterating over package entry points, dynamically\r\nimporting modules, and mutating the newly initialized converter.\r\n\r\nOn my machine, rendering an empty Markdown string takes 123 \u00b5s (\u00b1322 ns)\r\nwith a fresh converter, or 96.7 ns (\u00b11.05 ns) with a cached converter.\r\nBy default, the text plugin downsamples to 10 samples per time series,\r\nbut each sample can have an arbitrary number of Markdown calls when the\r\nsummary data is rank-1 or rank-2.

We\r\nexpect the tooltip the disappear when the cursor is on the edge of the chart.\r\n\r\nCause:\r\n1. For Polymer 2 and its Shadow DOM compatibility, TensorBoard opted out of the\r\nevent delegation of Plottable. Plottable, by default, attaches a set of event\r\nlisteners on document.body and invokes appropriate callbacks depending on the\r\ncircumstances. However, with the Shadow DOM, the event re-targetting broke\r\n(harder to identify `event.target`), so TensorBoard, instead, attaches the\r\nevent listeners on every Plottable container, SVGs.\r\n\r\n2. When mouse leaves (mouseout) the container, Plottable remaps the event as\r\nmouse move and calculate whether the cursor is inside a component\r\n(Interaction.prototype._isInsideComponent, specifically) to trigger appropriate\r\ncallback. The method, however is flawed since it returns, for a component that\r\nis, for instance, at <0, 0> with size of <100, 100>, true when pointer is at\r\n<100, 100>. It should only return true for [0, 100) for a given dimension,\r\ninstead.  As a result, the mouseout event occurred at <100, 100> was treated as\r\nan event inside the component but all the subsequent mouse movements are not\r\ncaptured since they are events that occurred outside of the event target. In\r\nvanilla Plottable, this bug do not manifest since event delegation on the\r\nentire document will eventually trigger mouse out when cursor is at, for\r\ninstance, <101, 100>.\r\n\r\nFix:\r\nOverwrote the method, _isInsideComponent, with the correct implementation.", "author_url": "https://api.github.com/users/stephanwlee", "committer_url": "https://api.github.com/users/web-flow", "author_commit_date": "2020-03-10T20:14:34Z", "committer_commit_date": "2020-03-10T20:14:34Z"}

Instead, we\r\ncan pull `is_active` handling into the core application logic, where\r\nboth the data provider and experiment ID are still available.\r\n\r\nA new data provider method `list_plugins` takes an experiment ID and\r\nreturns names of plugins with relevant data. A new (experimental) plugin\r\nAPI lets plugins specify whose data they want to read, defaulting to\r\njust their own. The `/data/plugins_listing` logic now joins the list of\r\nplugins with data (from the provider) with each plugin\u2019s list of data\r\nthat it cares about to determine which plugins are active. As a fallback\r\nfor plugins whose data is not yet understood by the data provider, we\r\nalso check `is_active` for plugins that don\u2019t pass the first test.\r\n\r\nThe new data provider method is optional (for now). If not implemented,\r\nthis patch has no effect.\r\n\r\nAs a side benefit, this can speed up the plugins listing route by a fair\r\namount: we only make one targeted query against the multiplexer rather\r\nthan querying all its `Tensors` once per plugin, and we don\u2019t need to\r\ninvoke `is_active` at all for plugins that are known to be active by\r\nthis first check.\r\n\r\nTest Plan:\r\nChange the `is_active` methods for the scalars, graphs, and histograms\r\nplugins to return `False` rather than `True` when a data provider is\r\nset. Then, run TensorBoard in generic data mode pointing at (a) the\r\nscalars demo, (b) the histograms demo, and (c) the images demo. Note\r\nthat in case (a) only the scalars and graphs dashboards are active, in\r\ncase (b) only the histograms and distributions dashboards are active\r\n(this demo does not write graphs), and in case (c) only the images and\r\ngraphs dashboards are active. Note that this behavior is the same across\r\ngeneric and non-generic data modes. Note that the behavior prior to this\r\npatch is restored if the implementation of `list_plugins` in the\r\nmultiplexer-backed data provider is removed, so this is a no-op until\r\ndata providers choose to implement this method.\r\n\r\nwchargin-branch: data-list-active-plugins", "author_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wchargin", "committer_url": "https://api.github.com/users/web-flow", "author_commit_date": "2020-01-10T18:54:20Z", "committer_commit_date": "2020-01-10T18:54:20Z"}

All existing invocations\r\nremain valid, and are now also available under the `tensorboard serve`\r\nsubcommand. Other subcommands may be injected programmatically. For\r\ninstance, we could migrate the existing `tensorboard --inspect` to\r\n`tensorboard inspect`, which makes more sense semantically (as it does\r\nsomething quite different from starting a web server).\r\n\r\nTo support both `tensorboard --flags` and `tensorboard serve --flags`,\r\nwe require some hacks first to get off the ground at all in Python 2,\r\nand then to have sane error messages without massive flag duplication in\r\nall Python versions. Even recent Python versions don\u2019t have a notion of\r\na _default_ subcommand, so we need to manually inspect `argv` to\r\ndetermine what kind of argument parser to construct.\r\n\r\nTest Plan:\r\nUnit tests added, and the smoke test for the dynamic plugin (plus the\r\nPip package test script) serve as integration tests for existing\r\nbehavior. It\u2019s important to test this in both Python 2 and Python 3. For\r\nmanual testing:\r\n\r\n  - Check that the output of `tensorboard --help` still includes all the\r\n    normal flags, and now has a list of subcommands (one item long).\r\n  - Check that the output of `tensorboard serve --help` is just like the\r\n    output of `tensorboard --help`, but without the list of subcommands.\r\n  - Patch a `demo` subcommand into `main.py`, and check that the output\r\n    of `tensorboard demo --help` is just that subcommand\u2019s help (without\r\n    flags to `serve`) and that `tensorboard --help` shows the `demo`\r\n    subcommand.\r\n\r\nFinally, note that changing the implementation of the monkey patch to\r\njust `yield; return` causes both `argparse_util_test` and `program_test`\r\nto fail on Python 2 (but not Python 3).\r\n\r\nwchargin-branch: subcommands", "author_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wchargin", "committer_url": "https://api.github.com/users/web-flow", "author_commit_date": "2019-10-19T06:55:46Z", "committer_commit_date": "2019-10-19T06:55:46Z"}

(#2476)\n\nCurrently, plugins must explicitly enumerate the routes that they serve via get_plugin_apps(). This is inconvenient in the case of plugins that provide a set of related routes, such as a directory full of static files, whose names need not be known in advance. This is the case, for instance, for dynamic plugins using Angular or React, where the build process produces a set of assets (including HTML, JS, CSS, source maps, etc.).\r\n\r\nThis PR allows a plugin to declare a wildcard route ending in /*, e.g. {'/foo/*': self._foo_wildcard_handler}. Any request beginning with the specified path prefix will be passed to the given handler.\r\n\r\nNote the handler may do whatever it likes with these requests; they do not necessarily correspond to filesystem paths (as in the static assets use case). Thus this change also allows for RESTful apis, where object IDs and such are encoded as path elements.

The goal is eventually to make everyone use 'schema' and to remove 'visibleSchema'.", "author_url": "https://api.github.com/users/erzel", "committer_url": "https://api.github.com/users/stephanwlee", "author_commit_date": "2019-06-17T22:59:31Z", "committer_commit_date": "2019-06-17T22:59:31Z"}

More\nspecifically, the problem happen because the tf-graph-loader was\nrefactored to take `selection` as the primary input to the loader and\nit used run & type of graph selected by user to fetch appropriate data.\nThis contrasts with previous input `datasets` which took a `path` as an\ninput which loader used to fetch the data from. tf-graph-app and\ntf-debugger-dashboard plugin were using the datasets prop to pass in\nthe special endpoint where the data lives.\n\nBefore describing refactor, we should define what the tf-graph-loader\nshould be. The loader is a UI-less functional component (renders no DOM;\nuses lifecycle method and props to provide some functionality) that is\ncapable of fetching various informations like graph, conceptual graph,\nand profile info (RunMetadata). We have recently introduce more\ncomplexity to it.\n\nInterestingly, all tf-graph variants (internal to Google too) does not\nmake use of any other data type other than the graph and there is almost\nno reason to use the tf-graph-loader. The graph utilities provide an\nability to fetch and parse GraphDef, create SlimGraph, and create a\nhierarchy with ease. The core values the tf-graph-loader provides are\n1. error handling and 2. progress tracker (uses Polymer API). By\nreusing the component, one can provide some consistency there.\n\nHere, in this case, we decided to put as much load+parsing into utility\nmethod and have loader specific to the dashboard while having another\nloader that is API compatible with old tf-graph-loader.", "author_url": "https://api.github.com/users/stephanwlee", "committer_url": "https://api.github.com/users/stephanwlee", "author_commit_date": "2019-04-23T20:07:38Z", "committer_commit_date": "2019-04-27T05:28:30Z"}

We don\u2019t provide a method\r\nto do this out of the box, because we don\u2019t actually provide any tuners\r\nat this time, but it\u2019s easy to write (e.g.) a `sample_uniform` function\r\nlike the one included in this commit.

Some\nhyperparameters are critically important, while others end up having\neffectively no impact. The experiment includes categorical, discrete,\nand real-valued hyperparameters.\n\nThe resulting parallel coordinates view looks something like this:\n\n![Screenshot of the parallel coordinates view][parcoords]\n\nIt\u2019s immediately obvious that the `optimizer` parameter is in fact a\nperfect separator for both accuracy and loss, whereas the influence of\nthe other hyperparameters is less clear. Filtering to the Adam-optimized\nsessions only, we can look at the scatter plot matrix:\n\n![Screenshot of the scatter plot matrix for `optimizer=\"adam\"`][matrix]\n\nHere, it\u2019s easier to see that `dropout` and `dense_layers` appear to\nhave negligible impact, while `conv_layers` and `conv_kernel_size` are\neach significant.\n\n[parcoords]: https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4317806/56250030-cf26d180-6062-11e9-9b46-daf29d8c0229.png\n[matrix]: https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4317806/56250052-e49bfb80-6062-11e9-911c-9bf4c868ef58.png\n\nThis demo uses only the existing hparams APIs, even when they\u2019re a bit\nawkward. We still need to manually manage file writers, construct protos\n(and `ListValue`s in particular\u2026), and duplicate domain information\nacross the experiment summary and our ad hoc tuner. Also, we can\u2019t\nspecify integer-valued hparams over ranges, because the `Interval` type\napplies only to real-valued hparams.

I've ported the python implementation to JavaScript to add an\r\nadditional projection method to the embedding projector.\r\n\r\nThe UMAP projection technique pretty much follows the approach for the\r\ntSNE projection. The UMAP code is grouped in its own directory for ease\r\nof maintenance. There are two things to note about this current\r\nimplementation of UMAP in the embedding projector:\r\n\r\n1) UMAP's SGD optimization doesn't really animate as nicely as t-SNE.\r\nI've addresses this by choosing not to animate the steps and just track\r\nprogress through a dialog.\r\n\r\n2) I'm currently reusing the GPU computed k-nearest neighbors - there\r\ndidn't seem to be too big of a difference between using the UMAP CPU knn\r\napproach vs the existing GPU approach in the projector. To note, the GPU\r\nknn approach uses cosine distance, while the rest of UMAP's\r\nimplementation uses euclidean distance.

As a quick hack, we could add special-case logic\r\nin `tf-tensorboard.html` to check for the profile plugin specifically.\r\nAs a longer-term solution, we could let the `tf_tensorboard.Dashboard`\r\ninterface specify an `isActive` callback, defaulting to `() => true`.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot of the \u201cProfiling isn\u2019t yet supported in Colab\u201d message][s]\r\n\r\n[s]: https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4317806/53541886-b83b1880-3ad0-11e9-9501-299f5e671d7a.png\r\n\r\nThe implementation includes a small refactor to the profile dashboard to\r\nmake it easier to introduce a new state.\r\n\r\nTest Plan:\r\nEvaluate `!!(window.TENSORBOARD_ENV || {}).IN_COLAB` in both standalone\r\nTensorBoard and Colab `%tensorboard`, and note that each evaluates to\r\nthe appropriate boolean.\r\n\r\nRun TensorBoard locally with the profile plugin\u2019s demo data, and note\r\nthat its behavior is unchanged.

If `--port=default` is specified,\r\nTensorBoard will attempt to bind to port 6006, just as prior to this\r\npatch. If this fails, TensorBoard will try to bind incrementally to\r\nports 6007, 6008, \u2026, giving up after 10 attempts.\r\n\r\nIf an explicit port is specified, TensorBoard will not try to search for\r\nother ports; it will fail (as before) if it cannot bind.

Run `bazel build //tensorboard` to build the main binary.\r\n 2. Run `which tensorboard` to find the `tensorboard` binary provided by\r\n    your virtualenv, and hit it with `chmod -x` to make it not\r\n    executable.\r\n 3. Run `export PATH=\"$(readlink -e ./bazel-bin/tensorboard):$PATH\"` to\r\n    add it to your path, and confirm that `which tensorboard` points to\r\n    the built version rather than the version in your virtualenv.\r\n 4. Run `jupyter notebook` to start the Jupyter server.\r\n 5. Create a notebook and execute `%load_ext tensorboard.notebook` to\r\n    load the extension; henceforth, `%tensorboard` should work until you\r\n    restart the Jupyter kernel.\r\n\r\n(Step (2) is necessary because the `jupyter notebook` runtime adds the\r\nvirtualenv _back_ to the front of your `PATH`. An alternative is to\r\npatch `os.environ[\"PATH\"]` from within the Jupyter notebook.)\r\n\r\nAfter setting it up as above, the following makes a good test plan\r\n(assuming that you have no other TensorBoard instances running):\r\n\r\n  - `%tensorboard --logdir ~/tb/mnist --port 6006` (should launch)\r\n  - `%tensorboard --logdir ~/tb/mnist --port 6006` (should reuse)\r\n  - `%tensorboard --logdir ~/tb/images_demo --port 6006` (should fail)\r\n  - `%tensorboard --logdir ~/tb/images_demo --port 6007` (should launch)\r\n  - `%tensorboard --logdir ~/tb/mnist --port 6006` (should reuse #1)\r\n  - multiple `%tensorboard`s in a single cell:\r\n\r\n    ```py\r\n    for i in (\"images_demo\", \"audio_demo\"):\r\n        %tensorboard --logdir ~/tb/$i --port 0\r\n    ```\r\n  - `from tensorboard import notebook`\r\n  - `notebook.list()` (should list four instances)\r\n  - `notebook.display(port=6006)`\r\n  - `notebook.display(height=800)`\r\n\r\nFinally, if you skip (or revert) step (2) from the setup instructions,\r\nyou can see the timeout behavior, because we\u2019ll invoke the `tensorboard`\r\nprovided by PyPI, which does not yet know how to write TensorboardInfo.\r\n\r\nwchargin-branch: notebook-jupyter", "author_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wchargin", "committer_url": "https://api.github.com/users/web-flow", "author_commit_date": "2019-02-07T22:34:59Z", "committer_commit_date": "2019-02-07T22:34:59Z"}

That\u2019s easy.\r\n\r\nSecond, the Travis build was hitting a numpy error that looks like\r\n<https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/12736>. We started hitting this\r\nnow because numpy 1.16.0 was released, and something in the Travis\r\nenvironment was causing a failure. The fix for this (included in this\r\ncommit) is to explicitly uninstall Travis\u2019s preinstalled `numpy`.\r\n\r\nThird, the Travis build was hitting a GCC error, wherein Bazel was\r\ninvoking `gcc` with the `-fcolor-diagnostics` argument, which Trusty GCC\r\ndoes not support. This one is puzzling, as the functionality that Bazel\r\nuses to test whether this argument is supported has not changed in a\r\nwhile. It\u2019s possible to reproduce the failure, but the circumstances\r\nunder which I could reproduce it are bizarre. Here is a full repro\r\nscript to be run on a fresh Ubuntu Trusty VM:\r\n\r\nhttps://gist.github.com/wchargin/15ce5e31ab0976edca33eb4c0e6c36dc\r\n\r\nClearing Travis caches for `master` and this pull request through the\r\nTravis UI does not fix the problem, but running `bazel clean --expunge`\r\ndoes. I added that into the `.travis.yml` file, which caused builds to\r\nsucceed even after I removed the `--expunge` line (i.e., the cache only\r\nneeded to be expunged once). Suffice it to say that we have no idea\r\nwhat\u2019s happening here and are simply hoping that we\u2019ve lucked out into\r\nnot having to deal with it again.\r\n\r\nTest Plan:\r\nRunning bazel run `//tensorboard/pip_package:build_pip_package` includes\r\na smoke test that fails before this change and passes after it.

Our dependencies also introduced some\r\nincompatible changes of their own. This commit upgrades our dependencies\r\nand fixes up our code to accommodate them.\r\n\r\nAn upgrade to transitive dependency `rules_go` introduces a dependency\r\non the `@bazel_tools//tools/build_defs/cc:action_names.bzl` builtin\r\ntarget. This target was only introduced in Bazel 0.16.0, so as a\r\nconsequence our workspace is no longer compatible with earlier versions\r\nof Bazel. In practice, we must use at least version 0.16.1 to fix a\r\nregression in 0.16.0: <https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/5726>.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, Bazel 0.16.0 also introduced a regression that prevents\r\nus from using the `--distinct_host_configuration=false` option; this has\r\nnot been fixed as of Bazel 0.20.0.

That would make it more of a \"chart tooltip\" and less of a \"bar tooltip\".\r\n\r\nFinally, I renamed \"points\" to \"bars\" everywhere in the drawTooltips() logic since they really are Bar objects and this was confusing - see the comment I reworded to explain that we are really passing in a `{key: String, value: Bar}` key-value pair into TooltipColumn.evaluate() and just telling TypeScript that it's a Point because that's what the signature requires.", "author_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nfelt", "committer_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chihuahua", "author_commit_date": "2018-03-14T01:39:20Z", "committer_commit_date": "2018-03-14T01:39:20Z"}

The two static assets in this case are \"index.html\" (the main vulcanized TensorBoard HTML blob) and \"trace_viewer_index.html\". Since \"index.html\" at a minimum is always served when using TensorBoard, this spends roughly 1 MB of extra RAM to move the cost of preparing it to startup-time so that it can be served directly from memory.\r\n\r\nPrior to this change, a typical request for those assets would involve 1) a disk read to open the assets_zip_provider webfiles.zip file, 2) unzipping that zip file, 3) extracting the index.html file from the zip archive, and 4) recompressing the file using gzip (about 40ms to compress 2.6MB down to 0.7ish) to send it back to the client.\r\n\r\nNow it's just served as precompressed gzip data directly from memory. From some basic testing on my workstation with a local TensorBoard, this changes the TTFB (Time To First Byte [1]) for index.html from about 100ms average to less than 5ms, and the average delay to DOMContentLoaded firing correspondingly drops from about 1000ms to 900ms.\r\n\r\nModern browsers pretty much all send Accept-Encoding: gzip but in case the user doesn't send that header, this change also adds support for decompressing precompressed data before responding. In theory we could avoid the decompression delay as well by also storing uncompressed assets in memory, but I opted not to because it complicates the Respond() API and the argument in favor is much weaker since decompression is typically faster than compression (in testing it took about 20ms for index.html) and we expect gzip supporting requests to be the vast majority, so it'd be spending more memory to save less time less often.\r\n\r\n[1] https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/network-performance/reference#timing-explanation", "author_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nfelt", "committer_url": "https://api.github.com/users/web-flow", "author_commit_date": "2017-11-28T19:10:47Z", "committer_commit_date": "2017-11-28T19:10:47Z"}

In doing so, TensorBoard compiles in seconds, rather\r\nthan taking a minute.\r\n\r\nThe ES6 `import` standard only defines / and ./ prefixed paths. All other paths\r\nthat exist are undefined. Since most tooling and early-adopter codebases rely\r\non the undefined behavior, the standard itself is mostly syntactic sugar (that\r\nisn't even sweet.)

Note that \"reading from the filesystem\" is not only reading once, but reading in all plugin assets from all runs, which could be dozens of reads per run, potentially over the network if using a remote filesystem.  In my testing this could easily cause `is_active()` to take 30+ seconds that kind of scenario, which in turn blocks the `/plugins_listing` response for the whole of TensorBoard.\r\n\r\nSince the TextPlugin's `is_active()` is based on its `index_impl()` (which backs its `/tags` route) and the expensive filesystem-checking logic is shared, this change puts the entirety of `index_impl()` on a background thread.  This way the `/tags` route can also benefit from not blocking.\r\n\r\nThe semantics are now that `is_active()` will return False and `index_impl()` will return a placeholder empty response when first invoked, but they'll kick off at most one background thread at a time to do the computation and store the resulting index response.  Once the plugin is detected to be active, `is_active()` will no longer kick off new background threads when invoked, but `index_impl()` will still kick off a new background thread when called (if one is not running already) so that refreshes will pick up new data as it gets written to the logdir.", "author_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nfelt", "committer_url": "https://api.github.com/users/web-flow", "author_commit_date": "2017-10-26T23:09:36Z", "committer_commit_date": "2017-10-26T23:09:36Z"}

Note that currently analytics is only enabled for internal Google users.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, sending pageview hits from _updateSelectedDashboard() was not really correct because that Polymer observer is invoked on any change to either observed property - the selected dashboard or the list of active dashboards. That means that as the active dashboards are loaded, every change to _activeDashboards will result in a duplicate page hit being logged for the currently selected dashboard.\r\n\r\nAs a special case of this, observers are also invoked a single time once their default values are all initialized to handle the default values (as a new change from \"undefined\"). So this also meant that on every page load we would send a pageview hit right away for the \"/\" page corresponding to the \"null\" default value of _selectedDashboard, even if loading e.g. http://tb/#scalars directly.\r\n\r\nThis fixes the first issue by changing _updateSelectedDashboard() to exclusively focus on setting the selected dashboard to the first active dashboard (if appropriate), and moving the pageview and hash updating into a separate observer _selectedDashboardChanged() that only observes _selectedDashboard. It fixes the second issue by making _selectedDashboard default to the value from the hash, so that loading http://tb/#scalars generates only a single pageview hit for \"/scalars\" rather than \"/\" followed by \"/scalars\".\r\n\r\nNote that the way I have it now, loading http://tb/ will still always generate that first hit for \"/\" even if the active dashboards result in immediately \"redirecting\" to e.g. http://tb/#scalars which then gets recorded as a second hit. I think this is reasonable since the user did still type in \"/\" and that way we can distinguish visitors to the TensorBoard \"home\" page who get redirected to the first active dashboard from visitors who go immediately to a preselected dashboard.\r\n\r\nLastly, this removes the extra pageview hit for \"/v/graph\" sent by tf-graph-dashboard; it was introduced before the automatic hash-based plugin pageview hits were added to tf-tensorboard, and it's pretty much just redundant with the hit for \"/graphs\" that the latter would generate.", "author_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nfelt", "committer_url": "https://api.github.com/users/web-flow", "author_commit_date": "2017-10-25T23:11:03Z", "committer_commit_date": "2017-10-25T23:11:03Z"}

That is, instead of compressing histograms at\r\nevent processing time, we compress them at serving time (when the\r\n`/distributions` route is requested). This should have no performance\r\nimpact, as the number of buckets in the histograms being compressed is\r\nat most 30 (unless the user overrides the default), and the compression\r\nalgorithm is already very efficient.\r\n\r\nHere is one subtle effect of this change: because the histograms and\r\ncompressed histograms had different reservoir sizes, naively applying\r\nthe change as described above would result in the time granularity of\r\nthe rendered distributions becoming significantly more coarse. (See\r\nscreenshots below.) To resolve this effect, we raise the histogram\r\ndownsampling threshold to that of the distributions, but perform\r\nadditional downsampling in the histograms plugin (and not the\r\ndistributions plugin). As a result, the amount of data sent over the\r\nnetwork in any given request is unchanged. It's true that more\r\nhistograms than before are stored in TensorBoard's memory, but the\r\nincrease should not be too great. Indeed, instead of thinking of the\r\nchange as increasing the amount of histograms stored, think of the\r\nchange as \"uncompressing\" all the already-compressed histograms and then\r\ndeleting all the original histograms. Because the uncompression factor\r\nis not too large (in turn because we're always compressing from 30 bins\r\nto 9 basis points), there shouldn't be any performance problems.\r\n\r\nHere are three screenshots. The first is the original dashboard. The\r\nsecond is the dashboard with this commit but without the dynamic\r\ndownsampling logic; this exhibits the coarse granularity issue described\r\nabove. The third is the dashboard after this commit, whose data is only\r\nimperceptibly different from the original data.\r\n![The distributions dashboard on master, before this commit](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4317806/28701498-730a2898-730b-11e7-9c16-201ba02cebd0.png)\r\n![The distributions dashboard with a version of this commit that did not include dynamic downsampling](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4317806/28701494-7088b544-730b-11e7-9ac4-72bef442b8c9.png)\r\n![The distributions dashboard after this commit](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4317806/28702387-7855821a-7311-11e7-8443-6c458f034c39.png)\r\n\r\nNote that the distributions dashboard now supports new-style histograms.\r\nIn fact, we get this for free, because the distributions dashboard now\r\nwraps the histogram dashboard plugin and post-processes its results!\r\nThis implementation change reflects the implicit dependency that the\r\ndistributions plugin has always had on the histograms plugin, making it\r\nan explicit dependency in the code.\r\n\r\nFull disclosure: the test data in `compressor_test.py` didn't make any\r\nsense. The histogram protos had `min` and `max` values that were\r\ndisjoint with the data, had bogus `sum` and `sum_squares` values, etc.\r\nI simply created reasonable test data and copied the results from\r\n\"actual\" to \"expected,\" so these tests trivially pass currently and from\r\nnow on can serve as regression tests. My test that the behavior is\r\nactually reasonable is to compare the first and third screenshots above\r\nand note that everything appears well-behaved: I cannot perceive a\r\nsingle difference in the output. (Also, the only changes that I made to\r\nthe algorithm were to redirect the appropriate inputs for the new\r\nformat.)\r\n\r\nTest Plan:\r\nAs described above, view the dashboard before and after this change, and\r\nnote that the distributions qualitatively appear very similar (though\r\nthe underlying data will of course not be exactly the same), while the\r\nhistograms dashboard is unchanged.

The only\r\nplugin that has been converted so far is the histogram plugin, and that\r\nplugin manages the compatibility itself. But it would be nicer to have a\r\nunified Event Translation Layer where we convert all the old-style\r\nevents to new-style events. Once we do this, plugin code will only have\r\nto deal with new-style events---which is especially attractive because\r\nit makes the plugins more copy-pastable.\r\n\r\nThis commit introduces `data_compat`, a module that will perform such\r\nconversions. This module will intercept events before the event\r\naccumulator processes them. This is forward-compatible with SQL mode:\r\nwe can simply call out to this module from the SQL loader instead of the\r\nevent accumulator. For now, `data_compat` converts histogram values and\r\nleaves everything else alone.\r\n\r\nI haven't connected this layer to the event accumulator because it has\r\nbreaking behavior for the distributions plugin, which depends on\r\nspecial-casing behavior in the accumulator.

(#204)\n\nThere is a general issue across TensorBoard: with the tf-paginated-view, if you\r\nswitch pages quickly, it's likely that some charts will be rendered when they\r\nare `display: none`. Data visualizations often depend on measurement code to\r\nlayout properly, and the measurements break when the item is not being\r\ndisplayed. As a consequence, the chart renders wih strange and broken\r\nproportions.\r\n\r\nWhen @wchargin and I were pair-programming this, we initially tried to work\r\naround the measurement issue so that the chart would layout properly even if it\r\nwere `display:none`, but that proved infeasible. So instead we decided to write\r\ncode to detect when the chart gets in a bad state, and fix it.\r\n\r\nThis code marks scalar charts as being in a bad state if their data finishes\r\nloading when the chart is no longer in an active pane. When the chart's pane\r\nbecomes active, an observer redraws the chart. Rather than redrawing\r\nsynchronously, we've set up an asynchronous redraw cascade with a 32ms timeout;\r\nthis way, we don't block the UI or unduly slow down the ripple on the\r\n\"next page\" button.\r\n\r\nNote, the bug actually exists on other dashboards (distributions and histograms\r\nboth repro it), and this fix only works on the scalar dashboard.

We now render the actual value in the \"Smoothed\" column\r\nwhen smoothing is disabled. (This makes sense: in the limit as the\r\nsmoothing factor goes to zero, the smoothed value approaches the scalar\r\nvalue, so this just makes the column continuous. It also makes the UI\r\nless dynamic and more predictable, which is nice.)\r\n\r\nThe existing code tries to remove the \"Smoothed\" column altogether when\r\nsmoothing is disabled. Although the data bindings are wired correctly,\r\nthe column continues to render in the tooltip even when the `dom-if`\r\nflips to `false`. It's completely unclear to me and @dandelionmane why\r\nthis is the case: the code certainly looks correct, and copying the\r\ntable structure verbatim into a fresh document demonstrates the right\r\nbehavior.\r\n\r\nWe're pretty sure that this is a bug in Polymer, and we've opted not to\r\npoke the beast, instead just taking our easy solution (which we like\r\nmore, anyway). That said, here is some more precise information about\r\nthis bug, should anyone feel an urge to investigate it.\r\n\r\nWe tried the following variations. The common factor seems to be that\r\nthe `dom-if` cannot properly hide when its child is a `<th>`.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<!-- These three headings properly hide when smoothing is disabled -->\r\n<th><template is=\"dom-if\" if=\"[[smoothingEnabled]]\">Smoothed1</template></th>\r\n<th><template is=\"dom-if\" if=\"[[smoothingEnabled]]\"><span>Smoothed2</span></template></th>\r\n<th><template is=\"dom-if\" if=\"[[smoothingEnabled]]\"><span>Smoothed3</span></template></th>\r\n\r\n<!-- These six headings do _not_ properly hide when smoothing is disabled -->\r\n<template is=\"dom-if\" if=\"[[smoothingEnabled]]\"><th>Smoothed4</th></template>\r\n<template is=\"dom-if\" if=\"[[smoothingEnabled]]\" restamp><th>Smoothed5</th></template>\r\n<th><template is=\"dom-if\" if=\"[[smoothingEnabled]]\"><th>Smoothed6</th></template></th>\r\n<th><template is=\"dom-if\" if=\"[[smoothingEnabled]]\" restamp><th>Smoothed7</th></template></th>\r\n<div><template is=\"dom-if\" if=\"[[smoothingEnabled]]\"><th>Smoothed8</th></template></div>\r\n<div><template is=\"dom-if\" if=\"[[smoothingEnabled]]\" restamp><th>Smoothed9</th></template></div>\r\n<!-- (end) -->\r\n```\r\n\r\n(This is unfortunate, because enclosing a `<th>` is exactly what we need\r\nthe template to do.)\r\n\r\nHere is a simple example wherein the bug _does not manifest_;\r\neverything works as expected:\r\n```html\r\n<link rel=\"import\" href=\"/polymer10/polymer/polymer.html\">\r\n\r\n<dom-module id=\"example-table\">\r\n  <template>\r\n    <table>\r\n      <thead>\r\n        <tr>\r\n          <th><!-- run color swatch --></th>\r\n          <th>Name</th>\r\n          <th><template is=\"dom-if\" if=\"[[smoothingEnabled]]\">Smoothed1</template></th>\r\n          <th><template is=\"dom-if\" if=\"[[smoothingEnabled]]\"><span>Smoothed2</span></template></th>\r\n          <th><template is=\"dom-if\" if=\"[[smoothingEnabled]]\"><span>Smoothed3</span></template></th>\r\n          <template is=\"dom-if\" if=\"[[smoothingEnabled]]\"><th>Smoothed4</th></template>\r\n          <template is=\"dom-if\" if=\"[[smoothingEnabled]]\" restamp><th>Smoothed5</th></template>\r\n          <th><template is=\"dom-if\" if=\"[[smoothingEnabled]]\"><th>Smoothed6</th></template></th>\r\n          <th><template is=\"dom-if\" if=\"[[smoothingEnabled]]\" restamp><th>Smoothed7</th></template></th>\r\n          <div><template is=\"dom-if\" if=\"[[smoothingEnabled]]\"><th>Smoothed8</th></template></div>\r\n          <div><template is=\"dom-if\" if=\"[[smoothingEnabled]]\" restamp><th>Smoothed9</th></template></div>\r\n          <th>Step</th>\r\n          <th>Time</th>\r\n          <th>Relative</th>\r\n        </tr>\r\n      </thead>\r\n      <tbody>\r\n        <tr><td colspan=\"13\">(content)</td></tr>\r\n      </tbody>\r\n    </table>\r\n    <style>\r\n      table {\r\n        margin-bottom: 20px;\r\n        outline: thin red solid;\r\n      }\r\n    </style>\r\n  </template>\r\n  <script>\r\n    Polymer({\r\n      is: \"example-table\",\r\n      properties: {\r\n        smoothingEnabled: Boolean,\r\n      },\r\n    });\r\n  </script>\r\n</dom-module>\r\n\r\n<dom-module id=\"example-host\">\r\n  <template>\r\n    <paper-checkbox checked=\"{{smoothingEnabled}}\"></paper-checkbox>\r\n    <example-table smoothing-enabled=\"[[smoothingEnabled]]\"></example-table>\r\n  </template>\r\n  <script>\r\n    Polymer({\r\n      is: 'example-host',\r\n      properties: {\r\n        smoothingEnabled: Boolean,\r\n      },\r\n    });\r\n  </script>\r\n</dom-module>\r\n\r\n<example-table></example-table>\r\n<example-table smoothing-enabled></example-table>\r\n<example-host></example-host>\r\n```\r\n\r\nTest Plan:\r\nMouse over a plot with a bunch of noisy data to bring up its tooltip.\r\nSet smoothing to 0.6, and note that the \"Smoothing\" and \"Value\" values\r\nare significantly different.

If a chart's `run` and `tag` properties are changed simultaneously,\r\n    two updates will be triggered, and the first update will see the\r\n    data in an inconsistent state (e.g., Tag B but still Run A). We fix\r\n    the resulting issues by making observer updates asynchronous, so\r\n    that they only actually take effect once all changes have flushed.\r\n    (This fixes #169.)\r\n\r\n 2. To reduce latency due to the above solution, we further debounce\r\n    these update handlers.\r\n\r\n 3. Because the handlers are asynchronous and debounced, we need to\r\n    maintain stronger invariants on the caching keys. (In particular, if\r\n    a chart changes from Tag A to Tag B and then to Tag C, we don't want\r\n    the network requests for Tag B to fill the runs-loaded cache and\r\n    then have Tag C forgo its fetches.)\r\n\r\n 4. Furthermore, when the tag of a chart is changed, we display a\r\n    loading indicator. This is to prevent problems in the scenario where\r\n    many charts change from one tag to another: in this case, all the\r\n    charts' titles will update immediately (they're just bound to text\r\n    nodes in the DOM), but charts' data will take a while to update; the\r\n    result is that there are many charts with titles that simply do not\r\n    match their data, which is at best very confusing. The loading\r\n    indicator makes it clear that the data is stale.\r\n\r\n 5. When a chart's tag is changed, we now reset the domain of the chart\r\n    once all the data has loaded. (This fixes #164.)\r\n\r\n 6. Finally, we offer a button to manually reset the domain of the\r\n    chart. (This is often useful when changing the set of selected\r\n    runs: after adding a new run, you may need to expand the domain, but\r\n    we don't do this automatically because you may often want to keep\r\n    your old domain.)\r\n\r\nIssues (1), (4), and (5) arise frequently when changing a search query,\r\nas this causes many charts to change their tag and runs.\r\n\r\nIssues (1), (2), and (4) apply to other dashboards as well, but have not\r\nbeen fixed. (Issue (3) would apply to other dashboards that display one\r\nvisualization per tag instead of per run-tag combination, but there are\r\nno such dashboards.)\r\n\r\nTest Plan:\r\nCherry-pick #173 before proceeding. (Without a search feature, the\r\neffects of this change are minimal---but I want to merge this change\r\nbefore I merge the search feature!)\r\n\r\nLaunch TensorBoard with a few dozen scalar tags. Suppose without loss of\r\ngenerality that the name of the fifth tag displayed in the search\r\nresults pane (on query `.*`) is `foo`. Set the search query to\r\n`(?!foo)`; this should still match all tags. Now, add a caret at the\r\nbeginning to search for `^(?!foo)`. Charts past the fifth one should\r\nreload. Check that the reloading behavior is pleasant.\r\n\r\nThen, zoom into some charts, manipulating their windows. Click the\r\n\"reload\" button, or wait 30 seconds, and ensure that the window is\r\npreserved.

I also moved some substantive tests into a\r\nhistogram test file. I can confirm that this file builds, but---like our\r\nother web tests---it does not actually run (\"Unexpected token import\").\r\n\r\nNote that both the old and new versions of the histogram dashboard have\r\nan unfortunate behavior regarding graphical updates after changing run\r\nselection state. Specifically, suppose that Histogram A and Histogram B\r\nappear side-by-side, and the run for Histogram A is toggled off. Then we\r\nwould like Histogram B to seamlessly move into the position of\r\nHistogram A. However, due to Polymer's data binding, the actual action\r\nis that Histogram B is deleted and Histogram A's data bindings are set\r\nto those of the former Histogram B. The result is that the title, tag,\r\nand card color of Histogram A immediately update to those of\r\nHistogram B, but the actual data takes a while to fetch. Furthermore,\r\nthis means that _all_ histograms that are affected will re-render their\r\ndata. (So if the line goes down to Histogram Z, then removing the run\r\nfor Histogram A will cause 25 network requests.)\r\n\r\nEssentially, we want [React's keys behavior][1], but it doesn't look\r\nlike we can get it. I'm leaving this wontfix for now.\r\n\r\n[1]: https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/lists-and-keys.html#keys\r\n\r\nFinally, while I'm at it, I fixed all closure compiler warnings in\r\n`vz-histogram-timeseries` and `tf-histogram-dashboard`.\r\n\r\nTest Plan:\r\nTested with the MNIST data combined with the histogram demo data.\r\nToggled runs, changed histogram modes and time modes, used tag groups,\r\nexpanded and collapsed categories. All bazel tests pass, but there\r\naren't actually any of interest, so that really just means that\r\neverything still builds.\r\n\r\nwchargin-branch: refactor-histograms-dashboard", "author_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wchargin", "committer_url": "https://api.github.com/users/web-flow", "author_commit_date": "2017-06-21T18:57:52Z", "committer_commit_date": "2017-06-21T18:57:52Z"}

It\nfulfills the same functionality as the existing `tf-run-selector` (note\nthe singular), but with a different and simpler API: it takes no input\nand produces as output a list of selected runs. It uses a centralized\nruns store as its source of truth; this will facilitate synchronizing\nall run selectors to the same set of runs.\n\nIt currently behaves the same way as `tf-run-selector` with the\nexception of the order of runs: this new component sorts the runs, while\nthe old component did not (so it was getting them in arbitrary order\nfrom the `/runs` endpoint). It seems like sorting them is a good\nidea---prefer determinism unless there's a good reason---but this will\nresult in a bit of drift among plugins with the old and new selectors in\nthis transition period. To combat that, I've made the color scale sort\nits domain, so that at least the colors are consistent.

First, it exposes two kinds of data: graph data and run metadata.\nWe elect to put both sources of data under the domain of the graphs\nplugin for now, because it's not clear that the run metadata would be\nuseful for anything else.

These tables are often initialized from large files stored on disk, and can take tens of minutes to load: increased the initialization timeout to give grappler enough time to load them.\r\nChange: 154303608\r\n\r\n* Add eager (static) checking to assert_equal when constant values are available.\r\n\r\nThis raises errors during graph creation, when possible, instead of at runtime.\r\nChange: 154304392\r\n\r\n* Add tf.log_sigmoid\r\n\r\nThis is a numerically stable version of tf.log(tf.sigmoid(x)).  It's just\r\n-tf.nn.softplus(-x), but it's easy to add and the identity is easy to mistype.\r\n\r\nRELNOTES: Add tf.log_sigmoid(x) = tf.log(tf.sigmoid(x)) = -tf.nn.softplus(-x).\r\n\r\nFixes #3719.\r\nChange: 154308666\r\n\r\n* GrapplerItem is a struct and not a class\r\nChange: 154319534\r\n\r\n* Migrate tf_storage and tf_globals to d3v4.\r\nChange: 154319656\r\n\r\n* Allow SVStepCounter to measure progress for other counters beyond global_step.\r\nChange: 154326389\r\n\r\n* Provide a user-defined default constructor to grappler::ItemConfig to avoid compiler error\r\nChange: 154331360\r\n\r\n* [tf contrib seq2seq] Update BeamSearchDecoder + AttentionWrapper API:\r\n* BeamSearchDecoder no longer tries to pass a tiling operator to the cell.\r\n* Instead the cell must \"know\" about the fact that batch_size is now bigger.\r\n* Much more explicit and careful error messages if batch sizes don't match.\r\n* Added helper function to tile the batch by beam_width.\r\n* AttentionWrapper now accepts an initial_cell_state argument (it'll pass the value back through when zero_state() is called).\r\nChange: 154333600\r\n\r\n* AllocationRegistry: only check fail if two different allocator types\r\nare defined for the same name and priority.\r\nChange: 154333776\r\n\r\n* Add a conversion from xla session module to a list of node structure as a step of xla computation transformation\r\nChange: 154337650\r\n\r\n* tfdbg: Improve the way uninitialized tensor values and DT_RESOURCE tensor values are displayed\r\n\r\n1.

The file paths contain clickable links to the existing print_source/ps command.\r\n\r\nThe list_source/ls command supports filtering by file-path and node-name regex patterns.\r\n\r\nUI fixes:\r\n* Fixed inconsistent black vs. transparent background color that made the layout look messy on some terminal types. Now using the transparent color for default font color consistently.\r\n* In the print_source command output, add clickable links to expand source lines and graph elements.\r\nChange: 152446002\r\n\r\n* tfcompile: Be a little more verbose about missing required flags.\r\n\r\nFixes #9014\r\nChange: 152446338\r\n\r\n* Disable failing test cases in pooling_ops_test.\r\nChange: 152447322\r\n\r\n* Register more types for tf.image_crop_and_resize().

A plugin may be inactive if say it lacks data. This new is_active method allows us to add a route to TensorBoard noting which plugins are active. The frontend could then avoid querying routes of inactive plugins.\r\nChange: 152406232\r\n\r\n* Replace a gather op for shapes by a stack op so dilated convolutions can be\r\nplaced on GPU even with strict placing (before the gather went to CPU).\r\nChange: 152411159\r\n\r\n* [TF:XLA] Implement BatchToSpace, BatchToSpaceND, SpaceToBatch, SpaceToBatchND.\r\nFix crashes in core implementations of the same operators for zero-sized blocks.\r\nChange: 152416903\r\n\r\n* Estimator saves relative paths in checkpoint.\r\nChange: 152420211\r\n\r\n* Fix layers_test exception regex matching.\r\nChange: 152422855\r\n\r\n* Unhide bijectors.

The file paths contain clickable links to the existing print_source/ps command.\r\n\r\nThe list_source/ls command supports filtering by file-path and node-name regex patterns.\r\n\r\nUI fixes:\r\n* Fixed inconsistent black vs. transparent background color that made the layout look messy on some terminal types. Now using the transparent color for default font color consistently.\r\n* In the print_source command output, add clickable links to expand source lines and graph elements.\r\nChange: 152446002\r\n\r\n* tfcompile: Be a little more verbose about missing required flags.\r\n\r\nFixes #9014\r\nChange: 152446338\r\n\r\n* Disable failing test cases in pooling_ops_test.\r\nChange: 152447322\r\n\r\n* Register more types for tf.image_crop_and_resize().

This route responds with an object mapping the name of each initialized plugin to whether it is active.\r\n\r\nThis route could help the frontend avoid issuing requests to inactive plugins.\r\n\r\nOrdered the listing of routes within application.py so there is a little more organization.\r\n\r\nRefactored the test for application to use a fake plugin.\r\nChange: 152451390\r\n\r\n* Added the ability to retrieve the amount of usable gpu memory\r\nChange: 152453470\r\n\r\n* Allow to set session ConfigProto in RunConfig and use it in Estimator.\r\nChange: 152454548\r\n\r\n* Colocate ResourceVariable reads with their handles.\r\nChange: 152455939\r\n\r\n* tfdbg: update doc for new command list_source/ls\r\nChange: 152456128\r\n\r\n* Make rnn directions slightly easier to follow.\r\nChange: 152456296\r\n\r\n* Internal change\r\nChange: 152458104\r\n\r\n* Adds batch renormalization.\r\n\r\nNOTE: if you use renormalization, you might want to use faster moving average updates, i.e. lower `decay` values.\r\nChange: 152458872\r\n\r\n* When using ImportGraphDef with a passed in ShapeRefiner, use the\r\nproducer version of the GraphDef when importing; the ShapeRefiner\r\nmay be initialized with a different graph_def_version, so we need\r\nto be able to override it.\r\n\r\nThe test failed without the change to graph_constructor and passes with it.\r\nThe test uses a legacy graph that is supported (reduction shape).\r\nChange: 152459169\r\n\r\n* Allow any iterable for `export_strategies` arg.\r\nChange: 152461826\r\n\r\n* Log steps/sec every 100 steps in MonitoredSession, as before.\r\nChange: 152465320\r\n\r\n* Fixes documentation to note that the in case of ties the identity of the return value of ArgMin and ArgMaxis not guaranteed .\r\nChange: 152465346\r\n\r\n* Automated rollback of change 152465346\r\nChange: 152465844\r\n\r\n* Fix shape inference fn on _ParallelConcatStart.\r\nChange: 152466076\r\n\r\n* Fix getting started guide\r\n\r\nExplain numerical differences in loss\r\nfix one example to print\r\nChange: 152466119\r\n\r\n* Remove superfluous mode argument.\r\nChange: 152467334\r\n\r\n* Add a tool that converts HLO computations to tensorflow GraphDef which can be visualized on Tensorboard.\r\n\r\nThis CL defines basic tensorflow::OpDef for each HLO instruction/node.

ProjectorScatterPlotAdapter creates a Float32Array of data point positions, and passes it into onPointPositionsChanged. Overhaul the visualizer interface, change 'onRecreateScene' to 'setScene', change 'removeAll' to 'dispose', change 'onUpdate' to 'onPointPositionsChanged', delete 'onDataSetChanged' entirely.\n\nRemove 'sceneIs3D' and 'backgroundColor' from onRecreateScene, they never really belonged there. The scene is /always/ 3D, the visualizers are really interested in the camera projection method, so now they query that. backgroundColor moved into the RenderContext, where it probably always belonged.\n\nSprite visualizer now observes new point arrays and creates the WebGL representation only if one doesn't already exist, or its buffers are too small to hold the current point array.\n\nScatterPlot directly uses THREE.AxesHelper, delete scatterPlotVisualizerAxes. (we might add it back later when scatter plot becomes more of a general-purpose reusable component, but it will need lots of work anyway).\n\nAdd 'util.vector3FromPackedArray', which loads array[i], array[i+1], array[i+2] into a THREE.Vector3 and replaces 'util.getProjectedPointFromIndex'.\n\nProjector no longer automatically renders the scatter plot when the positions / attributes change.\n\nBreak the trace visualizer's dependency on the selection context, it was causing problems when dataset filtering was being canceled. Add various Float32Array buffers for opacity and line width, generate them in the scatter plot adapter, and pass them into the render context with the rest of the 'attribute' data.\n\nWhen switching between sprites + labels mode, always add the trace visualizer.\nChange: 138426641", "author_url": null, "committer_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tensorflower-gardener", "author_commit_date": null, "committer_commit_date": "2016-11-07T21:05:14Z"}

Visualizers have direct access to the selected points and neighbors, and can decide their own semantics for display. Projector now prepares a color array of unselected points, which the visualizers use to render. 3D labels are rendered with unselected point colors. Add the HoverContext for observing and reporting hover events.\r\nChange: 135109425\r\n\r\n* Migrating skflow examples to the tensorflow/examples/learn directory.

Also moved related unit tests.\r\n  * Add title bar to CursesUI\r\n  * Add the predicate (filter) function has_inf_or_nan to module debug_data. Also added unit tests.\r\n  * analyzer_cli.py: Add methods \"add_tensor_filter\" and \"get_tensor_filter\" to support filtering of dumped intermediate tensors.\r\n  * local_cli.py: Add flag to on-run-start command \"run\", e.g., \"run -f has_inf_or_nan\", along with supporting logic for the run-till-a-tensor-filter-is passed mode.\r\n  * local_cli.py: Improved on-run-start summary lines for feed and fetch.\r\nChange: 135115989\r\n\r\n* Update left navigation for Python API.\r\nChange: 135121210\r\n\r\n* Fix ZeroInitializerOp for GPUs\r\n\r\nAlso changed it to use the C++ shape inference function.\r\nChange: 135123217\r\n\r\n* Use softplus in bernoulli.\r\nChange: 135125153\r\n\r\n* Automated rollback of change 135036941\r\nChange: 135125564\r\n\r\n* Get dnn_sampled_softmax_classifier_test to start running open source tests again. This change simply relaxes the testing criteria for a couple of tests so that everything can run in opensource tests regularly.\r\nChange: 135126062\r\n\r\n* Made the h2 in the graph panel only appear if there is a title.

While Seek() on RandomAccessInputStream\r\nsort of makes sense, Seek() on BufferedInputStream makes a little less\r\nsense.  I avoided adding Seek() to the InputStreamInterface because I didn't\r\nwant all implementors of InputStreamInterface to have to implement Seek(),\r\nonly those for which it made some sense.

Maintains existing APIs :)\n- Refactor how demo code works. It all now uses fake data from the gendata script.\n- Commit new demo data that contains example for every dashboard.\n- Revamp how the \"no data found\" warning works. The text is now saved in a single template component, which is re-used across dashboards. It now provides more useful info, like a link to the README, tutorial, and the specific section on debugging missing data.\n- The no data found warning now only appears if a successful load has occurred (it no longer displays while waiting for initial load).\n- Update tf-chart.ts to use the data format provided by the new backend\n- Remove tf-url-generator.html, tf-run-generator.html, urlGenerator.ts\n\nDetails:\n- move lib/js/backend to components/tf-backend. Necessary for our build process.\n- Merge lib/js/requestManager into components/tf-backend.\n- Create tf-backend/behavior.ts, a Polymer behavior that sets up a component to load tags from backend.\nThe behavior:\n  * Has a `reload` method for getting new tags\n  * Is parametric wrt to the data type to get from the backend\n  * Keeps track of load status (noload, pending, loaded, failure)\n  * Keeps track of when a load has occurred but no data was found\n  * Is thoroughly tested\n\n- Have event dashboard, histogram dashboard, and image dashboard use the behavior.\n- Have graph dashboard use tf-backend but not the behavior (it has no tags, so its semantics are slightly different)\n\n- generate_testdata.py now generates image data, and some graphs, and multiple runs\n- serialize_tensorboard now works for graphs\nChange: 118799535", "author_url": "https://api.github.com/users/decentralion", "committer_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tensorflower-gardener", "author_commit_date": "2016-04-01T18:59:17Z", "committer_commit_date": "2016-04-01T19:03:36Z"}

Also, tsd was behaving badly - running `tsd install` on a clean client was causing it to incorrectly depend on typing files from node_modules, which resulted in a broken build. This issue does not exist with typings.\n\nFor convenience, and since typings is really fast when all deps are up-to-date, I made it a part of the standard gulp task. `npm install` so you have all the deps, and running `gulp` will keep the typing files synchronized - there no longer is a separate step for downloading them.\n\nThe logical next step is to do the same for bower. I did wire that up, but I will not connect it to the gulp task until after the big bower dependency upgrade CL is through. If I add it right now, it will fail on unresolved dependency conflicts and make everyone sad.\nChange: 115370585", "author_url": null, "committer_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tensorflower-gardener", "author_commit_date": null, "committer_commit_date": "2016-02-23T20:56:41Z"}
